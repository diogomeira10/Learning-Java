//Functions

// Define the type of value the functions returns: 

//main is the entry point of the program
//functions must belong to a class
//functions that belong to a class are generally called methods.
// classes are used to organize our code
//Every Java program should have at least one class that contains the main function

// In Java , all the classes and methods should have an access modifier. Wich is a keyword that determines if other classes or methods can access these classes and methods

//naming classes with Pascal is a convention, 
//naming methods in camelCase is also a convention;

public class Main { //this is the class
    public void main() { // main function

    }
